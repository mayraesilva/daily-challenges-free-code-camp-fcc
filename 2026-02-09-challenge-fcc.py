Hi! My name is Mayra Silva and I'm studying to become a data scientist.
Today I'll be solving the daily challenge available on 8th, February, 2026.

----------------------------
2026 Winter Games Day 4: Ski Jumping
Given distance points, style points, a wind compensation value, 
and K-point bonus value, calculate your score for the ski jump and determine if you won a medal or not.

Your score is calculated by summing the above four values.
The current total scores of the other jumpers are:

165.5
172.0
158.0
180.0
169.5
175.0
162.0
170.0
If your score is the best, return "Gold"
If it's second best, return "Silver"
If it's third best, return "Bronze"
Otherwise, return "No Medal"

--------------------------
Tests
1. ski_jump_medal(125.0, 58.0, 0.0, 6.0) should return "Gold".
2. ski_jump_medal(119.0, 50.0, 1.0, 4.0) should return "Bronze".
3. ski_jump_medal(122.0, 52.0, -1.0, 4.0) should return "Silver".
4. ski_jump_medal(118.0, 50.5, -1.5, 4.0) should return "No Medal".
5. ski_jump_medal(124.0, 50.5, 2.0, 5.0) should return "Gold".
6. ski_jump_medal(119.0, 49.5, 0.0, 3.0) should return "No Medal".
