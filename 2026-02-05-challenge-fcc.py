Hi! My name is Mayra Silva and I'm studying to become a data scientist.
Today I'll be solving the daily challenge available on 5th, February, 2026.

----------------------------
Pocket Change
Given an array of integers representing the coins in your pocket, 
with each integer being the value of a coin in cents, 
return the total amount in the format "$D.CC".

100 cents equals 1 dollar.
In the return value, include a leading zero for amounts less than one dollar 
and always exactly two digits for the cents.
----------------------------
Tests
1. count_change([25, 10, 5, 1]) should return "$0.41".
2. count_change([25, 10, 5, 1, 25, 10, 25, 1, 1, 10, 5, 25]) should return "$1.43".
3. count_change([100, 25, 100, 1000, 5, 500, 2000, 25]) should return "$37.55".
4. count_change([10, 5, 1, 10, 1, 25, 1, 1, 5, 1, 10]) should return "$0.70".
5. count_change([1]) should return "$0.01".
6. count_change([25, 25, 25, 25]) should return "$1.00".
