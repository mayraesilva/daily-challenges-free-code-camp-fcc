Hi! My name is Mayra Silva and I'm studying to become a data scientist.
Today I'll be solving the daily challenge available on September, 18th, 2026.

----------------------------
Fill The Tank

Given the size of a fuel tank, the current fuel level, and the price per gallon, 
return the cost to fill the tank all the way.

- tankSize is the total capacity of the tank in gallons.
- fuelLevel is the current amount of fuel in the tank in gallons.
- pricePerGallon is the cost of one gallon of fuel.

The returned value should be rounded to two decimal places in the format: "$d.dd".

------
Tests:
1. cost_to_fill(20, 0, 4.00) should return "$80.00".
2. cost_to_fill(15, 10, 3.50) should return "$17.50".
3. cost_to_fill(18, 9, 3.25) should return "$29.25".
4. cost_to_fill(12, 12, 4.99) should return "$0.00".
5. cost_to_fill(15, 9.5, 3.98) should return "$21.89".

def cost_to_fill(tank_size, fuel_level, price_per_gallon):
    gallons_needed = tank_size - fuel_level
    total_cost = gallons_needed * price_per_gallon
    print(f"${total_cost:.2f}")
    return f"${total_cost:.2f}"
