Hi! My name is Mayra Silva and I'm studying to become a data scientist.
Today I'll be solving the daily challenge available on 8th, February, 2026.

----------------------------

2026 Winter Games Day 3: Biathlon
Given an array of integers, 
where each value represents the number of targets hit in a single round
 of a biathlon, return the total penalty distance the athlete must ski.

Each round consists of 5 targets.
Each missed target results in a 150 meter penalty loop
---------------------------
Tests:

1. calculate_penalty_distance([4, 4]) should return 300.
2. calculate_penalty_distance([5, 5]) should return 0.
3. calculate_penalty_distance([4, 5, 3, 5]) should return 450.
4. calculate_penalty_distance([5, 4, 5, 5]) should return 150.
5. calculate_penalty_distance([4, 3, 0, 3]) should return 1500.
