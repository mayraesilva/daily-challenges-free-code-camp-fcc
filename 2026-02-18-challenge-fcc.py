Hi! My name is Mayra Silva and I'm studying to become a data scientist.
Today I'll be solving the daily challenge available on 18th, February, 2026.

----------------------------
2026 Winter Games Day 13: Nordic Combined
Given an array of jump scores for athletes, 
calculate their start delay times 
or the cross-country portion of the Nordic Combined.

The athlete with the highest jump 
score starts first (0 second delay). 
All other athletes start later based on how far 
behind their jump score is compared to the best jump.

To calculate the delay for each athlete, 
subtract the athlete's jump score 
from the best overall jump score 
and multiply the result by 1.5. 
Round the delay up to the nearest integer.
----------------------------
Tests

1. calculate_start_delays([120, 110, 125]) 
should return [8, 23, 0].

2. calculate_start_delays([118, 125, 122, 120]) 
should return [11, 0, 5, 8].

3. calculate_start_delays([100, 105, 95, 110, 120, 115, 108]) 
should return [30, 23, 38, 15, 0, 8, 18].

4. calculate_start_delays([130, 125, 128, 120, 118, 122, 127, 115, 132, 124])
 should return [3, 11, 6, 18, 21, 15, 8, 26, 0, 12].
